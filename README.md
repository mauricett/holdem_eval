Texas Hold'em Hand Evaluator (WIP)

My own hand evaluator. Clearly a Work In Progress. 

Purposed functionality:

1. Monte Carlo All-In Equity (hero's hand vs. up to five hand hanges)
2. Find every player's exact rank during every stage of the game (not needed for All-In Equity!)

UPDATE:


Big Release: v0.1

1. Can calculate pre-flop allin equity of up to 6 players (no hand ranges yet)
