Texas Hold'em Hand Evaluator (WIP)

My own hand evaluator. Clearly a Work In Progress. 
So far, nothing is finished.

Purposed functionality:

1. Monte Carlo All-In Equity (hero's hand vs. up to five hand hanges)
2. Find a hand's exact rank during every stage of the game (not needed for All-In Equity!)
